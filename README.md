# YDB materialized view processor

The YDB Materializer is a Java application that ensures data population for user-managed materialized views in YDB.

Each "materialized view" (MV) technically is a regular YDB table, which is updated using this application. The source information for populating the MV is retrieved from a set of other tables, which are linked together through SQL-style JOINs. To support online synchronization of changes from the source tables into the MV, YDB Change Data Capture streams are used.

The destination tables for MVs, source tables, required indexes and CDC streams should be created prior to using the application in MV synchronization mode. The application may help to generate DDL parts for some objects — for example, it reports missing indexes and can generate the proposed structure of destination tables.

[See the Releases page for downloads](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb-materializer/releases).

## Minimal runnable example
Use these files for a minimal MV example:
- `scripts/example-tables.sql` (create tables and changefeed)
- `scripts/example-job1.sql` (MV + handler definition)
- `scripts/example-job1.xml` (application config)

## Requirements and building

- Java 17 or higher
- YDB cluster 24.4+ with appropriate permissions
- Network access to YDB cluster
- Required system tables created in the database
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) for building from source code

Building:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk-17.jdk/Contents/Home
mvn clean package -DskipTests=true
```

## Usage

YDB Materializer can be embedded as a library in a user application, or used as a standalone application.

The description of materialized views and their processing jobs must be prepared using a special SQL-like language. The corresponding descriptions can be provided as a text file or as a database table. Connection settings and various technical parameters are provided as a set of properties (programmatically via `java.util.Properties`, or as an XML properties file for the standalone application).

In standalone application mode, YDB Materializer implements:
- validation of materialized view and job definitions, including their compliance with the structure of source database tables, and output of corresponding error and warning messages for user analysis;
- generation and output of various SQL statements used by YDB Materializer, for further user analysis;
- service mode, in which it synchronizes the changes from source tables into the materialized view tables.

In embedded library mode, YDB Materializer implements all the listed functions, providing the ability to call them programmatically through methods of the corresponding classes.

For architecture and contributor-oriented notes, see [DEVELOP.md](DEVELOP.md) (Russian).

Maven dependency for embedding the YDB Materializer into the application, use the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb-materializer/releases):

```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>tech.ydb.apps</groupId>
            <artifactId>ydb-materializer</artifactId>
            <version>1.16</version>
        </dependency>
```

## Materialized View Language Syntax

The YDB Materializer uses a custom SQL-like language to define materialized views and their processing handlers. This language is based on a subset of SQL with specific extensions for YDB materialized views.

### Language Overview

The language supports two main statement types:
1. **Materialized View Definition** - Defines the structure and logic of a materialized view
2. **Handler Definition** - Defines how to process change streams to update the materialized view

### Materialized View Definition

Basic materialized view:

```sql
CREATE ASYNC MATERIALIZED VIEW <view_name>
  [DESTINATION <connection_name>]
  [OPTIONS <option_name> '<option_value>' [, <option_name> '<option_value>' ...]]
AS
  SELECT <column_definitions>
  FROM <main_table> AS <alias>
  [<join_clauses>]
  [WHERE <filter_expression>];
```

- The `SELECT` clause defines the list of tables being used as sources for the MV, as well as the relations between the source tables, in the form of a limited SQL query.
- The optional `DESTINATION` clause allows to put the MV into a separate database (see the related section below).
- The optional `OPTIONS` clause configures view-level behavior (see the related section below).

Composite materialized view:

```sql
CREATE ASYNC MATERIALIZED VIEW <view_name>
  [DESTINATION <connection_name>]
  [OPTIONS <option_name> '<option_value>' [, <option_name> '<option_value>' ...]]
AS
  (SELECT <column_definitions>
   FROM <main_table1> AS <alias>
   [<join_clauses>]
   [WHERE <filter_expression>]) AS <select_alias1>
UNION ALL
  (SELECT <column_definitions>
   FROM <main_table2> AS <alias>
   [<join_clauses>]
   [WHERE <filter_expression>]) AS <select_alias2>
UNION ALL
   ...
   ;
```

A composite materialized view definition consists of two or more SELECT subqueries, each with the same syntax as a basic materialized view query, combined using the `UNION ALL` operator. Each subquery must also contain an alias that is unique within the composite materialized view and used to identify the subquery during its processing.

#### Destination databases

By default, materialized view tables are created and updated in the same YDB database from which the input data is read, and which is configured through the `ydb.url` connection setting.

Optionally, a materialized view can be associated with a **separate destination database** by using the `DESTINATION` clause:

```sql
CREATE ASYNC MATERIALIZED VIEW <view_name>
  DESTINATION <connection_name>
AS
  SELECT ...
```

- **`<connection_name>`** is a logical name of an additional YDB connection.
- Source tables for the view are still read from the **main** database.
- All writes (`UPSERT` / `DELETE`) for the materialized view are executed against the **destination** database.

To use a non-default destination, define a separate connection in the configuration by prefixing standard YDB settings with `<connection_name>.`, for example:

```xml
<!-- Main database (source tables) -->
<entry key="ydb.url">grpcs://ydb01.localdomain:2135/cluster1/testdb</entry>

<!-- Separate destination database for MV `pk_test/mv1` -->
<entry key="altdest1.ydb.url">grpcs://ydb01.localdomain:2135/cluster1/testdb_mv</entry>
<entry key="altdest1.ydb.cafile">/path/to/ca.crt</entry>
<entry key="altdest1.ydb.auth.mode">STATIC</entry>
<entry key="altdest1.ydb.auth.username">root</entry>
<entry key="altdest1.ydb.auth.password">your_password</entry>
```

In the materialized view definition, reference this connection name:

```sql
CREATE ASYNC MATERIALIZED VIEW `pk_test/mv1`
  DESTINATION `altdest1`
AS
  SELECT ...
```

If the `DESTINATION` clause is omitted, the materialized view is written to the main database connection.

#### View options

Optional view behavior is configured with the `OPTIONS` clause. It may appear after the optional `DESTINATION` clause and before `AS`:

```sql
CREATE ASYNC MATERIALIZED VIEW <view_name>
  [DESTINATION <connection_name>]
  OPTIONS <option_name> '<option_value>' [, <option_name> '<option_value>' ...]
AS
  SELECT ...
```

Currently supported options:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `SKIP_DELETES` | boolean | `false` | When `true`, ignore `DELETE` events from all input changefeeds and do not issue `DELETE` against the MV table. `UPSERT` processing is unchanged. |

Boolean values are case-insensitive. Accepted forms include `true` / `false`, `yes` / `no`, `1` / `0`, and `y` / `n` / `t` / `f`.

Example:

```sql
CREATE ASYNC MATERIALIZED VIEW `skipdel_test/mv`
  OPTIONS SKIP_DELETES 'true'
AS
  SELECT main.id AS id, main.val AS val, fact.extra AS extra
  FROM `skipdel_test/main` AS main
  INNER JOIN `skipdel_test/fact` AS fact
    ON main.c1 = fact.c1 AND main.c2 = fact.c2;
```

When `SKIP_DELETES` is enabled:

- Rows are still refreshed on `UPSERT` events from `STREAM` and `BATCH` inputs, including updates on joined tables.
- `DELETE` events on source tables are not propagated to the MV; existing MV rows remain until removed out of band or overwritten by a later `UPSERT` for the same MV key.
- The MV may diverge from the result of the defining `SELECT` over current source data after source rows are deleted or no longer satisfy join conditions.

Use this option when deletes in source tables should not remove denormalized MV rows (for example, append-only facts or soft-delete patterns where the MV is treated as a historical snapshot).

In `SQL` and `SQL_DEBUG` output modes, generated `DELETE` statements are annotated as skipped at runtime when this option is enabled.

#### Column Definitions

Each column in the SELECT clause can be:
- **Direct column reference**: `table_alias.column_name AS column_alias`
- **Computed expression**: `#[<yql_expression>]# AS column_alias`
- **Computed expression with column references**: `COMPUTE ON table_alias.column_name, ... #[<yql_expression>]# AS column_alias`

#### Join Clauses

```sql
[INNER | LEFT [OUTER]] JOIN <table_name> AS <alias>
  ON <join_condition> [AND <join_condition>]*
```

Join conditions support:
- Column equality: `table1.col1 = table2.col2`
- Constant equality: `table1.col1 = 'value'` or `table1.col1 = 123`

#### Filter Expressions

The WHERE clause supports opaque (to the application) YQL expressions that are substituted unchanged directly into the generated queries:
```sql
WHERE COMPUTE ON table_alias.column_name, ... #[<yql_expression>]#
```

The presence of references to specific table and column names allows correct generation of derived SQL statements using opaque expressions that rely on specific columns of source tables.

### Handler Definition

```sql
CREATE ASYNC HANDLER <handler_name>
  [CONSUMER <consumer_name>]
  PROCESS <materialized_view_name>,
  [PROCESS <materialized_view_name>,]
  INPUT <table_name> CHANGEFEED <changefeed_name> AS [STREAM|BATCH],
  [INPUT <table_name> CHANGEFEED <changefeed_name> AS [STREAM|BATCH], ...];
```

#### Handler Components

- **PROCESS**: Specifies which materialized views this handler updates
- **INPUT**: Defines input tables and their changefeed streams
  - `STREAM`: Real-time processing of individual changes
  - `BATCH`: Batch processing of accumulated changes
- **CONSUMER**: Optional consumer name for the changefeed (if omitted, the handler name is used; if the handler name contains `/`, the last non-empty path segment is used)

### Opaque Expressions

The language supports opaque expressions wrapped in `#[` and `]#` delimiters. These contain YQL (Yandex Query Language) code that is passed through to the database without parsing:

```sql
-- In SELECT clause
SELECT #[Substring(main.c20, 3, 5)]# AS c11,
       #[CAST(NULL AS Int32?)]# AS c12

-- In WHERE clause
WHERE #[main.c6=7 AND (sub2.c7 IS NULL OR sub2.c7='val2'u)]#

-- With COMPUTE ON clause
COMPUTE ON main, sub2 #[main.c6=7 AND (sub2.c7 IS NULL OR sub2.c7='val2'u)]#
```

### Complete Example

```sql
-- Define a materialized view
CREATE ASYNC MATERIALIZED VIEW `test1/mv1` AS
  SELECT main.id AS id,
         main.c1 AS c1,
         main.c2 AS c2,
         main.c3 AS c3,
         sub1.c8 AS c8,
         sub2.c9 AS c9,
         sub3.c10 AS c10,
         #[Substring(main.c20, 3, 5)]# AS c11,
         #[CAST(NULL AS Int32?)]# AS c12
  FROM `test1/main_table` AS main
  INNER JOIN `test1/sub_table1` AS sub1
    ON main.c1 = sub1.c1 AND main.c2 = sub1.c2
  LEFT JOIN `test1/sub_table2` AS sub2
    ON main.c3 = sub2.c3 AND 'val1'u = sub2.c4
  INNER JOIN `test1/sub_table3` AS sub3
    ON sub3.c5 = 58
  WHERE #[main.c6=7 AND (sub2.c7 IS NULL OR sub2.c7='val2'u)]#;

-- Define a handler to process changes
CREATE ASYNC HANDLER h1 CONSUMER h1_consumer
  PROCESS `test1/mv1`,
  INPUT `test1/main_table` CHANGEFEED cf1 AS STREAM,
  INPUT `test1/sub_table1` CHANGEFEED cf2 AS STREAM,
  INPUT `test1/sub_table2` CHANGEFEED cf3 AS STREAM,
  INPUT `test1/sub_table3` CHANGEFEED cf4 AS BATCH;
```

### Language Features

- **Case-insensitive keywords**: All SQL keywords are case-insensitive
- **Quoted identifiers**: Use backticks for identifiers with special characters: `` `table/name` ``
- **String literals**: Single-quoted strings with optional type suffixes (`'value'u` for Utf8)
- **Comments**: Both `--` line comments and `/* */` block comments
- **Semicolon termination**: Statements must be terminated with semicolons

### Supported Data Types

The language works with standard YDB data types:
- **Text**: String data (use `'value'u` for Utf8 strings)
- **Numeric**: Int32, Int64, Decimal, etc.
- **Temporal**: Timestamp, Date, etc.
- **Complex**: JsonDocument, etc.

## Distributed Job Management (JOB Mode)

The JOB mode provides distributed job management capabilities, allowing to manage materialized view processing tasks across multiple instances. This mode is invoked using:

```bash
java -jar ydb-materializer.jar config.xml JOB
```

### Architecture Overview

The distributed job management system consists of two main components:

1. **MvRunner** - Executes jobs locally on each instance
2. **MvCoordinator** - Manages job distribution and coordination across runners

Each job is a running instance of the "handler" defined in the configuration.

On job startup, the configuration is re-read and re-validated by the application, and used in the particular job.

### Control Tables

The system uses several YDB tables to manage distributed operations:

#### Configuration Tables

**`mv/jobs`** - Job definitions and desired state
```sql
CREATE TABLE `mv/jobs` (
    job_name Text NOT NULL,           -- Handler name
    job_settings JsonDocument,        -- Handler configuration
    should_run Bool,                  -- Whether job should be running
    PRIMARY KEY(job_name)
);
```

**`mv/job_scans`** - Scan requests for specific targets
```sql
CREATE TABLE `mv/job_scans` (
    job_name Text NOT NULL,           -- Handler name
    target_name Text NOT NULL,        -- Target table name
    scan_settings JsonDocument,       -- Scan configuration
    requested_at Timestamp,           -- When scan was requested
    accepted_at Timestamp,            -- When scan was accepted
    runner_id Text,                   -- Assigned runner ID
    command_no Uint64,                -- Command number
    PRIMARY KEY(job_name, target_name)
);
```

#### Working Tables

**`mv/runners`** - Active runner instances
```sql
CREATE TABLE `mv/runners` (
    runner_id Text NOT NULL,          -- Unique runner identifier
    runner_identity Text,             -- Host, PID, start time info
    updated_at Timestamp,             -- Last status update
    PRIMARY KEY(runner_id)
);
```

**`mv/runner_jobs`** - Currently running jobs per runner
```sql

### Job Management Operations

#### Adding Jobs

To add a new job, insert a record into the `mv/jobs` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO `mv/jobs` (job_name, job_settings, should_run)
VALUES ('my_handler', NULL, true);
```

The coordinator will automatically detect the new job and assign it to an available runner.

The `job_settings` can be omitted (so that the default parameters will be used, loaded from global settings) or specified as a JSON document of the following format:

```json
{ # comment indicates the corresponding global setting
    "cdcReaderThreads": 4,                # job.cdc.threads
    "applyThreads": 4,                    # job.apply.threads
    "applyQueueSize": 10000,              # job.apply.queue
    "applyQueuePercent": 40,              # job.apply.queue.percent
    "selectBatchSize": 1000,              # job.batch.select
    "upsertBatchSize": 500,               # job.batch.upsert
    "dictionaryScanSeconds": 28800,       # job.dict.scan.seconds
    "queryTimeoutSeconds": 30             # job.query.seconds
}
```

The example above shows the defaults for regular jobs. For special dictionary scanner job the following settings can be specified:

```json
{
    "upsertBatchSize": 500,               # job.batch.upsert
    "cdcReaderThreads": 4,                # job.cdc.threads
    "rowsPerSecondLimit": 10000,          # job.scan.rate
    "maxChangeRowsScanned": 100000        # job.max.row.changes
}
```

#### Removing Jobs

To stop and remove a job:

```sql
UPDATE `mv/jobs` SET should_run = false WHERE job_name = 'my_handler';
-- or
DELETE FROM `mv/jobs` WHERE job_name = 'my_handler';
```

#### Requesting Scans

To request a scan of a specific target table:

```sql
INSERT INTO `mv/job_scans` (job_name, target_name, scan_settings, requested_at)
VALUES ('my_handler', 'target_table', '{"rowsPerSecondLimit": 5000}', CurrentUtcTimestamp());
```

#### Monitoring Operations

**Check running jobs:**
```sql
SELECT rj.runner_id, rj.job_name, rj.started_at, r.runner_identity
FROM `mv/runner_jobs` rj
JOIN `mv/runners` r ON rj.runner_id = r.runner_id;
```

**Check job status:**
```sql
SELECT j.job_name, j.should_run,
       CASE WHEN rj.job_name IS NOT NULL THEN 'RUNNING'u ELSE 'STOPPED'u END as status
FROM `mv/jobs` j
LEFT JOIN `mv/runner_jobs` rj ON j.job_name = rj.job_name;
```

**Check command queue:**
```sql
SELECT runner_id, command_no, command_type, job_name, command_status, created_at
FROM `mv/commands`
WHERE command_status IN ('CREATED'u, 'TAKEN'u)
ORDER BY created_at;
```

**Check runner status:**
```sql
SELECT runner_id, runner_identity, updated_at
FROM `mv/runners`
ORDER BY updated_at DESC;
```

### Command Types

The system supports four types of commands:

- **START** - Start a job on a runner
- **STOP** - Stop a job on a runner
- **SCAN** - Start scanning a specific target table
- **NOSCAN** - Stop the already running scan for a specific target table

### Job Names

Job name for regular jobs refer to the handler name. There are two special job names:

- **`ydbmv$dictionary`** - Dictionary scanner (manually managed)
- **`ydbmv$coordinator`** - Coordinator job (automatically managed)

These special names cannot be used for regular handlers (handler names must not start with the reserved prefix `ydbmv$`).

### Fault Tolerance

The system provides automatic fault tolerance:

1. **Runner Failure Detection** - Runners report status periodically; inactive runners are automatically cleaned up
2. **Job Rebalancing** - When runners fail, their jobs are automatically reassigned to available runners
3. **Command Retry** - Failed commands remain in the queue for retry
4. **Leader Election** - Only one coordinator instance is active at a time

### Deployment

1. **Create Control Tables** - Use the provided `scripts/example-tables.sql` script. Table names can be customized as needed
2. **Deploy Runners** - Start multiple instances with `JOB` mode
3. **Configure Jobs** - Insert job definitions into `mv/jobs` table. Add the scan definitions to the `mv/job_scans` table
4. **Monitor Operations** - Use the monitoring queries listed above

The system will automatically distribute jobs across available runners and maintain the desired state.

## Performance tuning

In practice, overall performance is primarily determined by the complexity of the queries that define a materialized view, rather than only by the number of worker threads. Expensive joins, large intermediate result sets, complex `WHERE` conditions (including opaque `#[ ... ]#` YQL expressions), and multiple `UNION ALL` branches directly increase the cost of each `SELECT` / `UPSERT` / `DELETE` statement issued by the YDB Materializer.

Handler job parameters below control how aggressively the YDB Materializer consumes changefeeds and applies updates for both **STREAM** and **BATCH** style handlers (including scan‑style batch operations and dictionary jobs):

- **`job.cdc.threads` / `cdcReaderThreads`**
  - Sets the number of parallel threads reading from CDC changefeeds.
  - **STREAM mode**: more threads increase the rate at which new events are read from YDB, which can improve end‑to‑end latency but also increases pressure on downstream apply workers and the database.
  - **BATCH mode**: more threads speed up reading and saving the accumulated changes into the intermediate table, but do not directly affect the end-to-end latency (which is mostly affected by `job.dict.scan.seconds` setting). Please note that the setting defined for the dictionary handler job is used (or the global setting if the specific setting for the dictionary handler is not defined) instead of the setting configured for the regular handler involved.
  - **Scan processing**: this setting does not affect scans, including the BATCH-induced scans inside the dictionary handler.

- **`job.apply.threads` / `applyThreads`**
  - Sets the number of worker threads that execute generated `SELECT` / `UPSERT` / `DELETE` statements to update the MV tables. The keys being processed are sent to the particular worker depending on the key value, so the contention on the single key never happens.
  - **STREAM mode**: more threads allow processing more change batches in parallel, improving throughput; too many threads may cause resource contention and overload the YDB cluster.
  - **BATCH mode**: same as for the STREAM mode. Using a significant number of threads combined with a large number of rows affected by the dictionary changes may lead to a large spike in the resource usage when the dictionary scan is activated.
  - **Scan processing**: same as for the STREAM mode. The total time required for scan execution depends on the amount of work (MV size) and scan speed, and the latter is limited both by the `job.scan.rate` setting and by the performance of the apply process, and the latter depends on the number of threads involved.

- **`job.apply.queue` / `applyQueueSize`**
  - Maximum number of changes queued for processing (size of the buffer between CDC readers and apply workers, as well as between the apply workers performing the key fetch operation and the apply workers performing the MV refresh). Each handler uses a counter (one per handler) for the total number of queued elements, and uses its value to pause reading extra input data from the CDC topics when the queues become too large. This effectively limits the memory used by the intermediate data inside the instance of the Materializer running the particular handler.
  - **STREAM mode**: a larger queue smooths short‑term spikes in incoming CDC traffic; if it is too small, CDC readers are throttled more often and end‑to‑end latency increases. If it is too large, the job may accumulate many pending changes in memory, increasing the memory usage and the time needed to drain the backlog.
  - **BATCH mode and scans**: defines how many prepared batches can wait for execution. Larger queues help keep apply workers busy but also increase memory footprint.

- **`job.apply.queue.percent` / `applyQueuePercent`**
  - Percent of the apply queue reserved for interactive (STREAM/CDC) operations. Default: `40`. In the regular (non-forced) submit path, batch work (scans and dictionary refresh) cannot occupy more than `applyQueueSize * (100 - applyQueuePercent) / 100` queue slots. Interactive work may still use the full queue up to `applyQueueSize`. This does not change the per-worker processing model (`drainTo` takes the current backlog as a whole), but prevents batch ingress from keeping the queue completely full and blocking STREAM enqueues. Forced submission of derived tasks (used to avoid deadlocks with key-based worker partitioning) may still temporarily exceed the limits, but remains accounted in the queue counters.

- **`job.batch.select` / `selectBatchSize`**
  - Limits how many source rows are read in a single `SELECT` statement when collecting data for a batch of changes.
  - **STREAM mode**: moderate values help group small reads efficiently while keeping read latency acceptable; increasing this value can reduce SQL overhead per row but may raise latency for individual changes, because larger batches wait longer to be processed.
  - **BATCH mode and scans**: directly affects the size of read operations during full or partial resynchronization. Larger batches improve throughput (fewer queries, better amortization of network round‑trips) but produce heavier queries for YDB.

- **`job.batch.upsert` / `upsertBatchSize`**
  - Controls how many rows are written in a single `UPSERT` or `DELETE` operation to destination MV tables.
  - **STREAM mode**: moderate values help group small updates efficiently while keeping write latency acceptable; very small values increase per‑row overhead, very large values may cause long‑running write statements that are more likely to hit timeouts or increase the overall latency of MV updates.
  - **BATCH mode and scans**: larger batches significantly increase write throughput during bulk refresh operations, but also amplify the impact of each individual statement (locks, resource usage, and potential retries). It is recommended to increase this value gradually and monitor YDB latency, error rates, and resource utilization.

- **`job.query.seconds` / `queryTimeoutSeconds`**
  - The maximum allowed time for the query to be executed. `CLIENT_DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` error is generated when the timeout is reached, and the query gets re-started. This parameter is a safeguard against hanging queries which could slow down the overall processing if allowed to run for the arbitrary amount of time. Should be chosen to allow for potentially complex queries to be executed, while still not allowing to consume too much execution time in the worst case, like getting executed on the overloaded YDB node.

- **`job.dict.scan.seconds` / `dictionaryScanSeconds`**
  - The interval between the checks for dictionary changes potentially affecting the MVs within the particular handler job.
  - **STREAM mode and scans**: no effect.
  - **BATCH mode**: larger time between the checks means more rare checks for the changes, which allows those changes to accumulate. Accumulating more changes allows to process those changes in a single scan, instead of running multiple scans for each smaller portion of changes. The related setting `job.max.row.changes` limits the total amount of the changes allowed to be processed in the single batch, which helps to ensure that too many dictionary updates will not overflow the memory of the current YDB Materializer instance.

When tuning these settings, start from the defaults, observe YDB metrics (latency, throughput, CPU, memory, query timeouts), then adjust one parameter at a time. For most workloads, it is safer to keep batch sizes and thread counts moderate for STREAM handlers (favoring predictable latency), and to use more aggressive values only for planned BATCH or scan operations where higher short‑term load is acceptable.
